Natural ventilation refers to the flow of air through a structure, driven by forces such as wind and buoyancy.

The course presents an overview of natural ventilation both through structures and natural occurring phenomena between and around building structures.  Setting up natural simulations are demonstrated using both the scheduled and calculated methodologies provided in DesignBuilder. 

Visualisation of the natural ventilation flow process is achieved through the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD).  This course demonstrates how the required boundary conditions are obtained through natural ventilation calculations and implemented into the CFD environment of DesignBuilder to allow the dominant flow patterns to be analysed and displayed visually.
