The DesignBuilder Optimisation module helps you to identify the design options with the very best combinations of cost, energy and comfort performance.

By gaining a clear indication of the trade-off between the various design options and their cost and impact on environmental performance you can more easily navigate the often complex relationship between design objectives, constraints and design options.  With the performance trade-off information at your fingertips it is so much easier to make informed decisions.

In the course we discuss the background of genetic algorithms used by the Optimisation module. Optimisation is compared to the simpler (but much slower) parametric analysis. An example of an optimisation test is shown from start to finish.
