The Daylighting module calculates daylight illuminance, average daylight factor and uniformity outputs for each zone using the advanced Radiance simulation engine.
Daylighting key features:

* Calculate Green Star credits (also: â€˜Right to Light', LEED, BREEAM)
* Generate high quality illuminance contour plots to illustrate daylight availability within each zone, block or slice through the whole building.
* Full multi-zone simulation covering transmission of light through exterior and interior windows.
* Daylighting photo realistic image Create photo-realistic rendered images in visualize.  
* Average daylight factors and uniformity data can be shown in tabular reports.
