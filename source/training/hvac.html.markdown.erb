This course shows how DesignBuilder is used to model modern HVAC systems down to component detail.

For this course we require that you have completed a DesignBuilder Day 1 and 2 course.

* Understand the relationship between DesignBuilder and EnergyPlus and how data is exchanged between the programs.
* Access the EnergyPlus folder to view in.idf, eplusout.rdd and eplusout.eso files.
* Use the DesignBuilder Results viewer to view in-depth HVAC data.
* Output detailed HVAC data to Excel.
* Understand EnergyPlus supply and demand loops.
* Set up a new, detailed HVAC system, starting from pre-defined templates or from scratch, using HVAC design tools.
* Add zone groups to accommodate areas served by different HVAC types.
* Modify characteristics of individual components in an HVAC system.
* Add additional chillers and set up chiller staging.
* Modify controllers (e.g. chiller set-points).
* Understand the EnergyPlus chiller model and input your own chiller performance curves.
* Perform post-processing of cooling and heating load data using your actual component performance data to obtain hourly energy results.
