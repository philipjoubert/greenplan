The course presents an overview of CFD and the underlying physics and numerical methods involved to obtain a converged solution.  Multiple topics are covered ranging from how to create an acceptable grid, ensure stability and determine whether the solution is correct.

During the course a demonstration of how to create a model suitable for CFD, applying suitable boundary conditions and running a simulation is provided.  Examples of both internal and external CFD simulations are discussed along with the various tools presented in DesignBuilder to enable effective visualisation of the results.
