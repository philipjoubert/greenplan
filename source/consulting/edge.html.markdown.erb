###The Challenge

Prior to the implementation of Journey, the processes used by BMS for managing its service operations were characterised by very high overheads and many repetitive manual tasks.

Combined with the inherent complexity of managing ATM service operations, this made for a daunting task and massive costs. Each time an ATM is serviced, the activities of more than 5 different parties need to be coordinated, including technicians, bank custodians, helpdesks, and cash-in-transit vehicles. The communication cycle is continuously repeated as the job progresses. BMS had to resort to manual phone calls for this purpose, resulting in an annual cellphone bill in excess of R1 million.

Banks require stringent reporting from maintenance providers such as BMS on compliance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) - every minute that an ATMs is not operating, the bank is losing money. BMS staff at each of the regional offices and at the head office were required to spend hours every month compiling data into Excel sheets to generate SLA Reports for the banks. Billing was a similarly cumbersome exercise, with paper job cards transported to head office and then painstakingly compiled into Excel sheets and reviewed half a dozen times by various staff before invoicing could take place.

Maintenance providers are also required to report the progress of each job to the banks as the job is being performed. For BMS, this meant employing 5 full-time helpdesk staff members who spent the majority of their time manually updating job information on banks’ helpdesk systems.

###The Solution

After the Journey solution was configured for BMS, a one-day training session was held at each branch to familiarise staff with the Journey system. Each technician was issued with a standard mobile handset running Journey software, with office staff accessing the Journey management and reporting portal from their web browsers. The Journey solution automates BMS business processes as far as possible, reducing the amount of manual tasks required to a minimum whilst providing unprecedented real-time visibility of all field activities.

The Journey system has been integrated with bank helpdesk systems, so that when a job is logged by the bank in their helpdesk system, the appropriate BMS technician immediately receives the job on his/her mobile phone. This eliminates the need for manual phone calls to dispatch technicians or relay information.

The Journey mobile software guides technicians through the process of completing jobs according to the exact industry processes - contacting the bank custodian to arrange a time, dispatching to site, arriving on site (entering odometer readings), commencing work, and closing the job. Along the way, the application prompts the technician to capture information such as selecting the parts that were used, completing checklists, taking photographs as proof of machine condition, and more.

BMS office staff can see the exact state of each job as it progresses in the form of an audit trail with associated GPS locations, and the information is also automatically reflected on the bank helpdesk systems.

Once the job is completed, the technician closes the job and the bank custodian signs electronically on the mobile phone’s screen as proof of service delivery. A electronic job card is then automatically generated in PDF format, immediately made available to BMS for invoicing purposes, and also automatically sent to the bank. “Paper job cards often went missing. The benefit of a paperless system such as Journey is that electronic job cards can’t go missing, and you can look them up instantly” says Jean-Christophe Bouche, General Manager. Rob Jansen, Senior Manager, adds: “The clients are much happier because they no longer have piles of paper job cards in their offices.”

Journey automatically tracks the time spent by technicians travelling to site and performing work, which is then shown on the electronic job cards, thereby further reducing the burden of administrative work on technicians. Journey also automates SLA compliance - automatic SMS and email notifications are pro-actively sent to different levels of managers at BMS if a job is at risk of missing its SLA target. Full industry-accepted SLA reports can also be generated at the click of a button - a fraction of the effort traditionally required.

Another benefit of the Journey solution is that it provides an asset register that is integrated with GPS locations and with all jobs, thereby providing the maintenance history of each machine.
  
###The Results

####Journey has greatly improved the efficiency at which BMS is able to operate.

“Journey has enabled us to maintain more machines with less manpower and less communication costs, while still honouring our SLAs with our clients”, Jean explains.

The time spent on manually capturing information for SLA reporting and billing purposes has also been cut down dramatically. “Regional Administrators no longer have to manually input job cards onto Excel, that’s a huge saving - it’s saves them at least a day per week” says Jean.

Senior Management were also able to free up their time by eliminating manual tasks. Jean adds: “There is no doubt that Journey has helped us improve management of BMS. I no longer have to prepare for hours for meeting with clients. If they want something, I pull it there and then from Journey. It gives us confidence, it gives the client confidence, and it saves time.”

####BMS was able to become more data-driven through having easy access to high-quality information through Journey.

“When you are in a meeting with a client, you are able to give them information there and then from Journey - it’s a great value-add. They will ask ‘What happened on this job?’, and we can open it straight away. The client has much more confidence when you can give them information immediately.” Jean explains. “What we’ve found is that the customer asks us for more and more data from Journey. For example, I was able to pull a report from Journey over a month period to prove to one of our big clients how much hours are wasted by technicians waiting on site before they can start working. I showed them it was thousands of hours per month. The other maintenance vendors don’t even track data in enough detail to make that possible. This builds confidence and strengthens our relationship with the client”. “More often than not, clients tell the other maintenance providers what they like about Journey, so that they can do better.”

####Journey has also enabled BMS to better honour its SLAs.

“We are more pro-active in preventing missed SLAs” says Rob. According to Dewald Smit, Regional Manager, “If a technician is not going to make it to a job and risk missing the SLA, you can easily see who else is available and dispatch them to the job.”

Clients also perceive BMS positively because of Journey. “A huge competitive advantage of Journey is that it makes us look more professional and more up to date with technology.” says Jean. “We definitely use Journey as a selling point and we tell all our clients and potential clients about it. We are doing some business with a new client now, and they love Journey.”

“Our ability to respond to the client is much faster than it used to be. Before, we had to make phone calls and wait for feedback, and it could take us 2 days to respond to a simple question. Now, we can look it up on Journey while we have them on the phone. Clients will sometimes claim that something happened in a certain way, and then pull the detailed audit trail from Journey and say: ‘No, here’s what actually happened’. We find that our data is often more accurate than that of the client.”

###Looking Ahead

BMS sees much potential for the future. “We are far from using Journey to its full potential”, says Jean. “The Journey staff have and continue to offer hands-on support whenever and wherever we require, their efforts have been professional and they have truly added value from system development, design and tailoring to training and implementation as well as post implementation support.“ says Jean. ”We look forward to a long and prosperous partnership with a fellow South African business that shares our values in terms of doing everything possible to meet customer expectations.”
