One of the disappointing aspects of the green building movement is that all too often, too little attention is given to fundamentally sound sustainable buildings design principles and buildings are declared “green”, based only on technological solutions like photo-voltaics etc. added on afterwards. 

Via in-depth analyses of building performance, focussing on orientation, solar loads and incorporating different facade design options, external shading etc., we can inform the design process, already at concept stage to ensure a sustainable outcome. (case study)  Greenplan have assessed the performance of hundreds of buildings in different climatic regions all over South Africa and we are ideally positioned to assist you in the design of truly sustainable buildings.

Rising energy costs have inspired many to consider alternative energy solutions in South Africa.  We can offer our services to determine what technologies would be most suitable for your projects. These include the use of:

* Solar thermal water heating
* Photovoltaic generation of electrical energy
* Energy-efficient heat pumps for air-conditioning
* Passive and mixed-mode ventilation systems
* Energy storage systems
