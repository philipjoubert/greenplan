#Mechanical Ventilation Design
<p class="intro-paragraph"><%= current_article.data.description %></p>

As mechanical engineers, we undertake mechanical ventilation designs for small projects in the Western Cape.  We design systems to meet the legal requirements of the National Building Regulations Part O, whilst respecting aesthetic and noise constraints specific to the project.

* Form 4 (mechanical ventilation) issued on completion of construction, provided the required verification information is supplied to Greenplan on completion.
