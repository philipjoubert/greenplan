We are thrilled to announce the launch of the [Community Support Forum](https://ask.journeyapps.com/) for Journey. If you have any questions about how to do something with Journey, come to the forum to find answers. The Embark Mobile team is closely monitoring the forum to provide fast feedback and nurture the community.

Those who are already familiar with the highly successful [*Stack Overflow*](http://stackoverflow.com/) will feel right at home, since our forum is based on [*OSQA*](http://www.osqa.net/), which in turn is inspired by *Stack Overflow*.

The forum is intended for technical questions regarding building apps. If you would like to suggest improvements to Journey, or if you run into any issues, please use the _Send Feedback_ button at the lower right corner of the Cloud Portal or App Editor as usual.

Please note that you will have to create a separate login to use the [Community Support Forum](https://ask.journeyapps.com/).
