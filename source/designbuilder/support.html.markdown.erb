##FAQ

DesignBuilder provides a powerful interface to the EnergyPlus building analysis tool, which allows users to design and analyse all aspects of a building including energy consumption, daylighting, HVAC, airflow and thermal comfort.
Navigating through the interface and translating the occasional error codes could be daunting at times. Here we try to answer most of the common questions relating to the DesignBuilder interface.

###Licensing
* **What is the difference between a network licence and "single-user" packages?** <br />
  A network licence (site licence + module seat licences) has the site licence installed on a single server in the organisation, which manages the licence seats for each module.
  Seats of a module refers to the number of persons that can use that module simultaneously, each on their own computer.
* **What is the [difference between an annual licence and a perpetual licence](http://greenplan.co.za/designbuilder/pricing#annual-vs-perpetual)?**<br />
* **How do I move an existing DesignBuilder single-user licence from an old to a new computer?** <br />
  First you need to deactivate your licence from the current computer before you uninstall the software.
  After you have completed this step, you can install DesignBuilder on the new computer and reactivate the licence.
* **I am using DesignBuilder v 4.7 for Part XA modelling.  I want to upgrade to a newer version. You only sell V. 6 licences but the latest Agrement certified version is V. 5.  Am I now stuck on V. 4 until Version 6 is certified?** <br />
No. Version 6 licences also activate Version 5 software - so you can buy a V.6 licence, install V.5 and activate it with the V. 6 licence. When v.6 is certified in future, you can deactivate V. 5, uninstall V. 5 then install V. 6 and activate it.  There is no upgrade fee since you would already own a V. 6 licence.
* **How do I deactivate my licence in version 4, 5 or 6?** <br />
  Note: Remote licence deactivation is not available after DesignBuilder Version 3!

  DesignBuilder V.4/5/6 licence deactivation can only be executed from within DesignBuilder’s License Manager dialog (Help->License) by selecting the activation code to be deactivated on the ‘Activation Code’ tab and pressing the ‘Deactivate’ button.

  If the code is not displayed, then the ‘Reset’ button should be used instead. An internet connection is required during the deactivation and activation process.

  Uninstalling DesignBuilder will **not** automatically deactivate the licence from the machine.

  If you have uninstalled DesignBuilder but need to release the activation code so it can be used on another machine, then you should first reinstall the *same version* of DesignBuilder as previously installed on the machine, then follow the deactivation process described above.<br />
* **How do I set up a site licence (network licence)?** <br />
See our guide **[here](http://www.greenplan.co.za/resources/SITE LICENCE - Activation Instructions for Network licenses_rev03.19_Greenplan-Amended_Rev1.pdf)**. This includes tips for off-site access.

###Modelling
* **Where can I find help on how to model in DesignBuilder** <br />
The **[DesignBuilder U.K. website](https://designbuilder.co.uk/designbuilder/training)** has many online videos and tutorials available showing you how to do most of the things you need for creating models. Please consult the relevant section of the DesignBuilder help manual available from within your DesignBuilder software.<br />
* **What do I need to do SANS 10400-XA rational assessment/design?** <br />
  In order to be capable of performing and signing-off SANS 10400-XA assessments, you will require:
  * A copy of the SANS 10400 standard.
  * A copy of the SANS 204 standard.
  * Attendance of an approved SANS 10400-XA training course.
  * Agrément SA approved building energy modelling software such as DesignBuilder.
  * Preferably attendance of a [course](http://www.greenplan.co.za/training) in using the software package you choose to use.

  Note that DesignBuilder Version 5 is certified for SANS 10400 Part XA rational design (Agrément  Certificate  [2018/584](http://www.greenplan.co.za/resources/2018-584_DesignBuilder5.pdf)).

###Troubleshooting
* **Abnormal Termination error.** <br />

  *"Abnormal EnergyPlus termination. Please contact DB support"*

  This error is usually caused by small calculations errors during the transcription of the model into the EnergyPlus environment. The primary causes for this error include:

  * Holes in the floors which do not line up precisely with the corresponding hole in the ceiling below.
  * Windows that are too close to facade edges and risk exceeding the usable surface area.
  * Component blocks that interfere with each other or building blocks.

* **File Corruption** <br />
  Some DesignBuilder users have reported problems with .dsb files becoming corrupted. You may see a message like:

  *"Error loading file <br/>
  Filename<br />
  This could be caused by trying to read a file created in a more recent version of the software or because the file is corrupt. If you think the file is corrupt you should be able to find incremental backups in the DesignBuilder Data\Backup folder."*

  There are various possible reasons for this:

  * **Removable flash drives (USB data sticks)** <br />
    Removing data sticks (flash drives) from the computer while a write operation is still in progress can cause files to be corrupted.

  * **Error in file compression** <br />
    This can be checked for by opening the .dsb file in WinZip, WinRAR or other compression/decompression software. If it opens OK then compression is not the problem. Problems with compression may be caused by conflicts with other software installed on the system. If this is the cause then you can work with the .skh (uncompressed) format.

  <!--* **Opening or saving the .dsb file over a network** - fixed in DesignBuilder Version 5.5<br />
    This operation is not supported by DesignBuilder and corruption problems are far more likely due to possible network errors so you should always load and save to the local disk drive.

  * **Dropbox (or similar cloud file sharing system) folders, which can lock files for syncing to storage on cloud servers** - fixed in DesignBuilder Version 5.5<br />
    If you try to work on Dropbox or OneDrive folders your data will eventually become corrupted as DesignBuilder tries and fails to save to a locked file. Workaround: Pause syncing whilst <em>opening</em> a DesignBuilder model.<br/>-->

  * **Bugs in some versions of the software can cause problems opening .dsb files** <br />
    It may be worth trying a later version of the software to see if it can read a corrupt file.

  If, having followed the above advice, you are still unable to open a file you could try sending it to **[DesignBuilder Support Desk](http://support.designbuilder.co.uk/)** to see if the developers are able to recover it.
