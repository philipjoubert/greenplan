#Which option is for you?

DesignBuilder is structured as a modular solution,  comprising a core 3-D modeller and nine modules that work together to provide in-depth performance analysis for any building.  Every module integrates fully with its counterparts, so you can pick individual modules or choose one of our packages.


###Packages
For *architects*: If you’re designing a renovation or new-build project, DesignBuilder is perfect for early design stage simulations and compliance modelling.

- **Architectural Essentials:** 3D Modeller with Simulation, Visualisation & Daylighting modules

- **Architectural Plus:** 3D Modeller with Simulation, Visualisation, Daylighting, *Cost & Optimisation* modules

For *engineers*: Minimise the ‘energy gap’ for your clients with DesignBuilder’s advanced modelling.

- **Engineering Essentials:** 3D Modeller with Simulation, Visualisation, Daylighting, Cost, *HVAC & LEED* modules

- **Engineering Plus:** 3D Modeller with Simulation, Visualisation, Daylighting, Cost, HVAC, LEED, *Optimisation & Scripting* modules

- **Engineering Pro:** 3D Modeller with Simulation, Visualisation, Daylighting, Cost, HVAC, LEED, Optimisation, Scripting & *CFD* modules

For *academic institutions*: Universities worldwide use DesignBuilder for teaching since it is accessible to learn, and for research since it is so powerful. Any of the above packages may be licensed to a learning institution.

###Modules

* **3-D Modeller**	- The core module, our efficient 3-D building modeller.
* **Visualisation**	- Visualisation: Stunning rendered images and site shading analysis.
* **Simulation**	- EnergyPlus simulations for energy and comfort analyses.
* **Daylighting**	- Reports daylight factors and illuminance using Radiance.
* **HVAC** - A powerful and flexible interface to EnergyPlus HVAC.
* **Cost**	- Early stage building cost estimation.
* **LEED** - LEED EAp2 and ASHRAE 90.1 calculations.
* **Optimisation**	- Multi-criteria optimisation to help meet design goals.
* **Scripting**	- Access to the EnergyPlus Energy Management System allows you to customise the behaviour of the HVAC equipment, controls and facades with sophisticated logic and custom integration with other codes.
* **CFD**	- Computational Fluid Dynamics calculates distribution of air properties such as velocity, temperature and pressure in and around buildings.
