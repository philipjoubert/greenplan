#DesignBuilder Resources

###Free 30-day software trial

Feel free to **[download](https://www.designbuilder.co.uk/software/free-30-day-evaluation)** a 1 month free trial version of the software. (Only Version 6 may be trialled. Free user registration on the site is required. The few restrictions on functionality are described **[here](https://designbuilder.co.uk/evaluation-license-restrictions)** and would only affect advanced usage.)

###Hardware requirements

DesignBuilder is a professional graphics application and requires a high standard of computer hardware for successful use.  This page contains information on the minimum system requirements and also the recommended specification. The main areas you should pay attention to if you are buying or upgrading your computer system to run DesignBuilder are:

Graphics adapter - a good 100 % OpenGL-compatible graphics adapter is required to run DesignBuilder. Most of the NVIDIA cards we have tested work well.  Some graphics adapters integrated with the motherboard are unable to run DesignBuilder as are some ATI graphics cards.

* Memory: DesignBuilder will use all the memory you can throw at it - at least 8 GB is recommended for serious modelling.
* CPU speed: Get as fast as you can afford.
* CPU cores: Having more than one processor core does not necessarily speed up simulations in DesignBuilder but it does allow you to continue using your computer while simulations are running. Multi core processors also make the software more responsive in use.

####Windows environment

* Microsoft Windows 7 or better (Windows 10 recommended)
* 2.4 GHz dual core processor (i5, i7 or Xeon quad core processor recommended)
* 4 GB (or more) RAM
* 5 GB free disk space (200 GB recommended)
* Pointing device (3-button scroll mouse highly recommended)
* 100% OpenGL compatible 3D graphics adapter with hardware acceleration running in 32-bit colour mode
* 1280x1024 pixels or larger screens for efficiency during the modelling process and for displaying high-quality visualisation images and walk-throughs of DesignBuilder models and CFD results. DesignBuilder works well with wide screens.

####Mac environment

DesignBuilder has been developed using a Windows-specific software development system and there is no immediate prospect of the software running natively under the Mac operating system.
However the latest Mac computers do support two alternative approaches to running Windows software:

1. Boot Camp where Intel-based Mac computers can be booted using either the Mac or Windows operating systems. This is the recommended approach to use if possible as it runs faster and more reliably than...
2. Virtual machines such as Parallels.

###Recommended versions
* For Version 5 licences: Version 5.5.2.007
* For Version 4 licences: Version 4.7.0.022 (not .027)
* For Version 3 licences: Version 3.4.0.041 (or as required for compatibility with old project models)

###Learning resources
  For additional information on the software, you can also visit the **[DesignBuilder website](http://www.designbuilder.co.uk)**.  The site offers several free online **[tutorials](https://designbuilder.co.uk/training/tutorials)**, **[webinars](https://designbuilder.co.uk/training/webinars)** and **[additional learning resources](https://designbuilder.co.uk/training/other-learning-materials)** (including course material from MIT), explaining the software in more detail.  There is also free access to the **[knowledgebase](https://support.designbuilder.co.uk/index.php?/Knowledgebase/List)** and **[public forums](https://designbuilder.co.uk/forum/)**.
