				Greenplan offers DesignBuilder Software sales, technical support and training in Southern Africa.  The software arguably represents one of the most advanced and user-friendly building performance software analysis packages available in the world today.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				DesignBuilder provides advanced modelling tools in an easy-to-use interface. This enables both architects and engineers to use the same software to develop comfortable and energy-efficient building designs from concept through to completion. You can build up models from scratch, using DXF or PDF 2-D drawings or importing 3-D models via gbXML format.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Architectural simulation packages allow you to link with BIM solutions, analyse solar shading, maximise the use of renewable technologies, test facade options and check the potential for natural ventilation to provide cooling all in one place, adjusting as you go according to client requirements.
			</p>

			<p>
				High quality technical and rendered outputs help communicate findings to clients in a way they can easily understand. Key performance indicators such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, thermal comfort, daylight availability and cost can be provided throughout the design process in both naturally ventilated and air-conditioned buildings.
