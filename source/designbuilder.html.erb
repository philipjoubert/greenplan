				DesignBuilder is arguably the most advanced and user-friendly building performance analysis software available in the world today. It is versatile and can be used for a number of purposes, including building energy assessment, thermal comfort prediction, natural ventilation estimation, and daylight level calculation.

				Greenplan has partnered with DesignBuilder UK to ensure that South Africa has access to the best tools on the market.  As the sole South African agent for <%= link_to "DesignBuilder Software", "http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/" %> we provide sales, technical support and training in Southern Africa.

				DesignBuilder provides advanced modelling tools in an easy-to-use interface. This enables both architects and engineers to use the same software to develop comfortable and energy-efficient building designs from concept through to completion. You can build up models from scratch, using DXF or PDF 2-D drawings or importing 3-D models via gbXML format.

      <h2>SANS 10400-XA Certified</h2>

      <p>
        DesignBuilder has been certified by Agr√©ment South Africa for energy modelling of buildings (Version 5 included). It is suitable for calculating energy requirements of all building types, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Small domestic buildings.</li>
        <li>Large commercial and institutional buildings with complex Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning systems.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Simulation results suitable for both rational design routes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Model reference and actual buildings and compare results.</li>
        <li>Model actual building and compare with stipulated energy thresholds.</li>
      </ul>
